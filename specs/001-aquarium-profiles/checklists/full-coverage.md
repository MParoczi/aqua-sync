**Purpose**: Thorough requirements quality validation across all domains (UX, data, navigation, edge cases) for author self-review before task generation
**Created**: 2026-02-15
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md) | [plan.md](../plan.md) | [data-model.md](../data-model.md)

**Note**: This checklist is generated by the `/speckit.checklist` command based on feature context and requirements.

## Requirement Clarity

- [ ] CHK015 - Is "muted/greyed styling" for archived cards quantified with specific visual properties (opacity level, color treatment, badge position)? [Ambiguity, Spec §FR-016]
- [ ] CHK016 - Is "subtle warning" for duplicate aquarium names defined with specific UI behavior (inline text, info bar, icon)? [Ambiguity, Spec Edge Cases]

- [ ] CHK025 - Are the card detail fields listed consistently between FR-002 (thumbnail, name, type, volume, date) and US1-AS2 (same list)? [Consistency, Spec §FR-002, §US1-AS2]
- [ ] CHK026 - Is the "description/notes" field naming consistent across spec (§FR-004), clarifications (§Session), data model (Description field), and key entities (description/notes)? [Consistency]
- [ ] CHK027 - Do the editability rules in Clarifications, FR-010a, and FR-010b align without contradiction (all three agree on which fields are editable vs. locked)? [Consistency, Spec §Clarifications, §FR-010a, §FR-010b]
- [ ] CHK028 - Are substrate editing scenarios consistent between US3 ("during creation or from profile settings") and FR-010 ("at any time after profile creation") — do both cover the same access points? [Consistency, Spec §US3, §FR-010]
- [ ] CHK029 - Does the data model's VolumeUnit default of "Liters" align with spec requirements, or should the creation form have no preset default? [Consistency, Data Model vs Spec §FR-004]

## Acceptance Criteria Quality

- [ ] CHK030 - Is SC-001 "under 2 minutes" measured from a defined starting point (dialog open, button click, or app launch)? [Measurability, Spec §SC-001]
- [ ] CHK031 - Is SC-002 "within 2 seconds" measured from cold start (application launch) or warm navigation (returning to selector)? [Measurability, Spec §SC-002]

- [ ] CHK035 - Are success criteria defined for the archive/restore lifecycle separately from the general lifecycle in SC-006? [Gap, Spec §SC]

## UX & Interaction Scenario Coverage

- [ ] CHK036 - Are requirements defined for the creation dialog's cancel/dismiss behavior when the form contains unsaved data (confirm discard, auto-save draft, or silent dismiss)? [Coverage, Gap]
- [ ] CHK037 - Are requirements defined for what happens when the user dismisses or cancels a substrate entry mid-edit within the creation dialog? [Coverage, Gap]
- [ ] CHK038 - Are keyboard navigation requirements defined for the selector grid (arrow keys, Enter to select, Tab order)? [Coverage, Gap]
- [ ] CHK039 - Are card layout requirements defined for responsive grid behavior (number of columns at different window widths, card dimensions, spacing)? [Coverage, Gap]
- [ ] CHK040 - Are requirements defined for how locked fields are visually distinguished from editable fields in the profile edit context? [Coverage, Spec §FR-010b]
- [ ] CHK041 - Are requirements defined for inline validation feedback timing (real-time as user types, on blur, or on save attempt only)? [Coverage, Gap]
- [ ] CHK042 - Are requirements defined for the creation dialog's scroll behavior when the form content exceeds the dialog height? [Coverage, Gap]

## Data Model & State Coverage

- [ ] CHK043 - Are numeric precision requirements defined for volume and dimension fields (number of decimal places accepted and displayed)? [Coverage, Data Model]
- [ ] CHK044 - Is the gallery folder lifecycle explicitly documented in the spec's functional requirements, not just the plan (FR-019 says "associated data" but doesn't mention gallery folder by name)? [Gap, Spec §FR-019]
- [ ] CHK045 - Are substrate entry count limits specified or explicitly declared as unbounded? [Gap, Spec §FR-009]
- [ ] CHK046 - Is the handling of corrupted or manually-edited aquarium JSON files defined (skip, error, attempt repair)? [Gap, Edge Case]
- [ ] CHK047 - Are requirements defined for whether archived profiles retain their thumbnail and substrate data integrity when viewed in read-only mode? [Completeness, Spec §FR-016a]
- [ ] CHK048 - Is the SetupDate type specified as date-only or date-with-time in the spec requirements (data model uses DateTimeOffset but the UX likely expects date-only input)? [Consistency, Spec §FR-004 vs Data Model]

## Navigation & Architecture Coverage

- [ ] CHK049 - Are requirements defined for what happens if the shell is open and the underlying aquarium data becomes unavailable (JSON file deleted externally)? [Coverage, Gap]
- [ ] CHK050 - Is the behavior specified when the user navigates back from the shell to the selector grid — does the grid refresh to reflect any changes made in the shell? [Coverage, Gap]
- [ ] CHK051 - Are requirements specified for the ShellPage header content (aquarium name display, type badge, status indicator for archived)? [Gap, Spec §US4]

## Edge Case & Failure Coverage

- [ ] CHK052 - Are requirements defined for grid performance and behavior with a large number of profiles (50+, 100+) — pagination, virtualization, or explicitly unbounded? [Edge Case, Gap]
- [ ] CHK053 - Is the behavior defined when the gallery/{id} folder is missing but the ThumbnailPath field references it (fallback to default graphic, error, or silent recovery)? [Edge Case, Gap]
- [ ] CHK054 - Are requirements defined for attempting to archive an aquarium that is currently being viewed in the management shell (from another window or app instance)? [Edge Case, Gap]
- [ ] CHK055 - Is the behavior defined when a photo upload fails mid-copy (partial file, permission error) — rollback previous thumbnail or leave as-is? [Edge Case, Gap]
- [ ] CHK056 - Are requirements defined for volume/dimension input handling with locale-specific decimal separators (comma vs. period)? [Edge Case, Gap]

## Non-Functional Coverage

- [ ] CHK057 - Are accessibility requirements specified for screen reader support on selector grid cards and creation form elements? [Gap]
- [ ] CHK058 - Are high contrast mode requirements addressed or explicitly deferred for the selector grid and forms? [Gap]

- [ ] CHK060 - Are requirements defined for the application's behavior when launched with a previously archived "last selected" aquarium in context? [Gap]

## Dependencies & Assumptions Validation

- [ ] CHK061 - Is the assumption "layer depth uses parent aquarium's DimensionUnit" promoted from Assumptions to a functional requirement, since it affects data display and validation? [Assumption, Spec §Assumptions]
- [ ] CHK062 - Is the assumption "default thumbnail is a static asset bundled with the application" reflected in FR-007, or is it only in Assumptions? [Assumption, Spec §Assumptions vs §FR-007]
- [ ] CHK063 - Is the assumption "duplicate names are permitted" documented with its rationale (multiple tanks with similar names) as a deliberate design decision rather than an oversight? [Assumption, Spec §Assumptions]
- [ ] CHK064 - Is the assumption "photos stored at original resolution with no compression" (Constitution §Hard Constraints) reflected in spec requirements for photo upload? [Assumption, Constitution vs Spec §FR-008]

## Notes

- Check items off as completed: `[x]`
- Items marked `[Gap]` indicate requirements that are missing entirely and should be added to the spec or documented as intentional omissions
- Items marked `[Ambiguity]` indicate vague language that should be quantified or clarified
- Items marked `[Conflict]` indicate potential contradictions between documents that need resolution
- Items marked `[Consistency]` indicate cross-reference checks between spec sections or across artifacts
- Items marked `[Assumption]` indicate assumptions that may need promotion to formal requirements
- CHK024 (Settings page conflict) is the highest-priority item — it represents an architectural decision that needs explicit resolution before task generation
